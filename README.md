# Stonks-Thing

○ A project that i used for a task set by Bank Of America.

○ I was working on this for college, but I thought I'd share it here. 

○ I think with some tweaks you could hook it to an API and pull the most recent stock markets, for a wider amount of companies (In fact, I might do it myself.)

○ I will also probably change the UI too and try to improve for it to be actually useful(?).

○ As this is my first project I think it LGTM, if anyone sees this and has suggestions lmk!
